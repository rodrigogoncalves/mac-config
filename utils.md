# Homebrew

As of 05/2015, intall is performed by `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.

Package maintenance is issued by `brew update`.

A list of top-level installed packages (i.e. excluding automatically installed dependencies) can be generated by `brew leaves`, and my current set is available in the file `brew-leaves.txt`. Binary "casks" installed by Brew's caskroom/cask are found in the file `brew-casks.txt`.


# NodeJS

Command to install the latest version: `brew install node`


For other versions:

`brew tap homebrew/versions` to install named versions support for Brew;

`brew install node010` and possibly `brew link --overwrite node010`
